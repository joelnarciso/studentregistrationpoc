Student Registration Proof of Concept

This small project is created as a proof of concept for a student registration system. At its current version, it includes the following functionalities:

 - Login as a user
 - Login as an administrator
 - Register new student details
 - Find existing student details using the student ID number
 - Update existing student details
 - View the student list report
 - View charts

To use the tool, the following files must be at the same directory:
 - Student_Registration_POC.xlsm
 - dbStudents.accdb

When opening the tool, make sure to click the 'Enable Content' button when the Security Warning is shown. This will allow the tool to execute the macros in order to perform its functions.

Note: When trying to log in as the administrator, any non-blank text is accepted as a valid password. As this is only a proof of concept, there is no authentication process in place.
